    description: `Srimangal is the tea capital of Bangladesh, located in the north-eastern part of the country. You’ll find lush green tea gardens anywhere you go here. This is one of the few places in the country where if you look around, you may not find any other people anywhere except you. A really nice and calm place. Cycling through the trails inside the tea plantations here could be one of the best things you can do in Bangladesh. Also worth visiting is the Lawachhara National Park, and trek to Hamham waterfalls. You can easily spend a few days here with nature. Srimangal comes as number three on our list of the best places to visit in Bangladesh.`,
